Diet Description: For halal compliance: Actively look for ingredients that are strictly forbidden in a halal diet, per info fishs are halal, such as any form of alcohol in consumable products, as well as pork and its derivatives. If there's uncertainty regarding the halal status of a meat ingredient or if it lacks a clear halal certification, consider the product non-halal. However, if alcohol appears in a product that's clearly not meant for ingestion (e.g., hand sanitizers, cosmetics), it can be viewed as compliant. Always give preference to clear labeling and certain indications.",
